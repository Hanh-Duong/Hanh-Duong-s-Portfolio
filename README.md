# Hanh-Duong-s-Portfolio
This webpage showcases what I have done as an in-house brand graphic designer and my journey towards passion as a UX designer. My journey was interrupted here and there in the path of studying to be a UX designer because sometimes I want to slow down to look deeply into myself, study languages and spend my time on the growth of my children.
